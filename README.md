An AI player that uses the MiniMax algorithm and alpha-beta search in order to play the Gomoku game against an opponent.

## Disclaimer
The GUI and game functionality provided courtesy of the Artificial Intelligence module at Queen Mary University of London. Only the functionality of the AI was created by myself.

## Gameplay
The game is played as follows: two players (white and black) take turns at placing a stone of his/her colour on an unoccupied square on the board (white moves first). The first player to complete a continuous horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of 5 or more stones of his/her colour is the winner (scoring 2 points). The loser scores 0. If all squares are occupied and neither player has won, then each player gets 1 point.
